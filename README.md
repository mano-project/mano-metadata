# MANO Metadata  

**Manuscript descriptions contributed to the MANO project and displayed on the MANO Metadata Collection page.**  

This repository contains **JSON files** describing manuscripts.  
Each JSON file represents a single manuscript (or a set of manuscripts) and is automatically displayed on the [MANO Metadata Collection page](https://mano-project.github.io/collection.html).  



## Overview  

- Each **JSON file** contains the metadata of one or more manuscripts.  
- Files must be placed in the `data/` folder of this repository.  
- The manuscripts appear automatically on the MANO Metadata Collection page, where users can:  
  - Search by  manuscript name, repository or location
  - Filter by responsible person, repostitory, content authors, text language, font description, place of origin or provenance  
  - View full metadata details  
  - Download in JSON or XML format or prinatble PDF.  


## How to Contribute a Manuscript Description  

### 1. **Log in to GitHub**  
- You need a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).  
- If you already have one, sign in.  


### 2. **Describe the manuscript using the MANO Metadata Editor**  

- Go to the **[MANO Metadata Editor](https://mano-project.github.io/editor.html)**.  
- Fill in all the manuscript details.  
- When finished, click **Download JSON**.  
- You now have a `.json` file describing the manuscript.  


### 3. **Upload the JSON file to this repository**  

1. Go to the [MANO Metadata repository](https://github.com/mano-project/mano-metadata/tree/main/data)  
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**  
3. Drag & drop your `.json` file  
4. Click → **Commit changes**  

This will create a new manuscript record.  



## What happens next?  

The manuscript will **automatically appear** on the [MANO Metadata Collection page](https://mano-project.github.io/collection.html), where users can:  

- Search by title, repository, or location  
- Filter by responsible person, repostitory, content authors, text language, font description, place of origin or provenance  
- Open a **full detailed record**   
- Download the description as JSON or XML 
- Download a printable PDF 


## Best Practices  

- Use the **MANO Metadata Editor** to create JSON files (do not edit manually).  
- Use a clear, unique filename for the manuscript. 
- Double-check your metadata before uploading.
